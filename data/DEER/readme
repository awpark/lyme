DEER DENSITY

We have collated categorical data of White-tailed deer (WTD) density estimates collected by state departments of natural resources (DNR). The categories recorded are no deer, less than 15 deer/mile2, between 15 & 30 deer/mile2, between 30 & 45 deer/mile2, and more than 45 deer/mile2. Some DNR agencies record density at the county level, while others use a natural landscape. For consistency, we import graphic versions of data into ArcGIS, and rectify it onto a standard polygon layer of the US counties in the WGS84 geodetic system and geographic coordinates. We then convert and export the rectified image into a raster layer of the entire lower 48 states. Finally, we then import this raster layer in R using the raster package, and extract the mode and maximum of the values (density categories) from the pixels of each county. The result is a tabular dataset of mode and maximum deer density estimates for each county.
